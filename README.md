# ProjectAutomation

This repository contains mirror for the [ProjectAutomation](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/tree/main/Sources/ProjectAutomation) framework in the tuist main repository.

This enables users to add this framework to their `Package.swift` without having to download _all_ the dependencies the main repository has.

## Usage
